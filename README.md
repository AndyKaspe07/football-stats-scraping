# Football Player Statistics Retrieval Project
### The aim of this project is: <br />
1. Collect the name of any football player from the user. <br />
2. Scrape data from football statistics website <br />
3. Process and clean this data<br />
4. Present to the end-user in a table format. <br />

The .ipynb is just me getting familiar with the syntax and is not part of the project.
Main.py holds the entire code. 

## Example of an interaction with the program
